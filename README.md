### Hi, I'm Cinthia. Welcome to my profile! :+1: 

#### :mortar_board: I graduated as a computer engineer, but my path in the game development world didn't start at that moment. 

:two::zero::one::three: I started my university studies at the Computing Sciences University in Cuba. :books:

:two::zero::one::seven: I started my practical studies in VERTEX, the center specialized in video games development. :computer:

:two::zero::one::nine: I presented as my bachelor thesis the video game "The Wumpus world", based on artificial intelligence techniques. :video_game:

By then, I already had **skills** in:
